What we want to do
A: Make a cookie clicker game

OBJECTIVE
1.Objective of the game is to click on the pokemon to defeat it and gain rewards per pokemon that has been defeated.
2.With the rewards, we can purchase upgrades and/or hire other entities to help defeat stronger pokemons
3.OPTIONAL OBJECTIVE~Every certain amount of pokemon defeated will spawn a BOSS pokemon to defeat for greater reward, HOWEVER, there is a time limit to defeat it.
    - Condition: If defeated, next level
            Else: If not defeated, restart from 1st pokemon from current level (You do not lose anything or may)
                - Players may skip and go straight to the BOSS pokemon when they are ready but this condition is only available if they were defeated.
