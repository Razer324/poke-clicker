What we want to do
A: Make a cookie clicker game

OBJECTIVE
1.Objective of the game is to click on the pokemon to defeat it and gain rewards per pokemon that has been defeated.
2.With the rewards, we can purchase upgrades and/or hire other entities to help defeat stronger pokemons
3.OPTIONAL OBJECTIVE~Every certain amount of pokemon defeated will spawn a BOSS pokemon to defeat for greater reward, HOWEVER, there is a time limit to defeat it.
    - Condition: If defeated, next level
            Else: If not defeated, restart from 1st pokemon from current level (You do not lose anything or may)
                - Players may skip and go straight to the BOSS pokemon when they are ready but this condition is only available if they were defeated.

THINGS TO KNOW:
- Logarithmics Exponentials (algrebra)
    example: x = x * 1.5 per pokemon
- The amount of damage we do to the pokemon plus the upgrades and other entities that assist in subtracting the value of the pokemon's damage value.



CONCEPT

1st pokemon will start with 10HP and you must click the pokemon to subtract that HP value until HP is (HP <= 0)
2nd pokemon will start with 1st pokemonHP + (some expontial value) and same conditions as above and so on.


Damage value for clicking on the pokemon is 1
Upgrades can increase Damage value per click (example 1st upgrade adds 1 making each click equal 2 instead of 1)
Hired Entities increase Damage value over time 

THINGS WE NEED
1. Pokemons with names to click on


THINGS TO DO
1. Make object clickable to reduce HP of pokemon
2. Make pokemon disappear when HP value conditions are met
3. Create new pokemon to click on and so on (repeat 1 and 2)


~~~~~~

For every pokemon defeated, we get points. But how many points?
